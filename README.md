EmotiConstruct - Dynamic Icon-Font for use in any web application.
===================

A dynamic, or static, icon-font for emoticons. Use them on their own, or stack them to create custom emoticons. If you aren't familiar with how Font Awesome stacks icons, go look here first: http://fontawesome.io/examples/#stacked. I take NO credit for the innovation of this concept, I am just making a huge library of emoticon parts and pieces to take the stacking idea to a huge scale of making emoticons. Full credit is given to Font Awesome for the idea of how to do it.

The way EmotiConstruct's work is the same as other icon-fonts, like Font-Awesome. The EmotiConstructs work by simply allowing you to include one like this:

<i class="ec-smile"></i>

But, the real radness is making your own emoticons:
```
  <i class="ec-stacked"><i>
    <i class="ec-tophat"><i>
    <i class="ec-lincoln-beard"><i>
    <i class="ec-frown"><i>
    <i class="ec-square-face-base"></i>
  </i>
```
This could be made like this:  =]:([] (or something). OR, if you just want them to be in a visual wysiwyg style emoticon chooser, the user would just see the Abraham Lincoln and have no clue that it's actually just components stacked on top of eachother to create infinite custom emoticons.

This would make a Abraham Lincon looking emoticon, all with the font glyphs stacked to look like a singular icon. This allows you to make anything you want as part of your project, or use a system where your users could construct them through ASCII.

This lets you have your own emoticons that can just be built by you ahead of time and not dynamically user creatable, or you could let users make them. Either way. And, there would be a set of default, single icons that you can use without complex stacking.

This is all a concept right now, but that's the plan. If you want to join up, email erik@helloerik.com. You can illustrate, code, help make fonts, anything you want!
