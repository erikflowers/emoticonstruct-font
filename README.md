EmotiConstruct - Dynamic Icon-Font for use in any web application.
===================

A dynamic, or static, icon-font for emoticons. Use them on their own, or stack them to create custom emoticons.

The way EmotiConstruct's work is the same as other icon-fonts, like Font-Awesome or Weather-Icons. The EmotiConstructs work by simply allowing you to include one like this:

<i class="ec-smile"></i>

But, the real radness is making your own emoticons:
```
  <i class="ec-stacked"><i>
    <i class="ec-tophat"><i>
    <i class="ec-lincoln-beard"><i>
    <i class="ec-frown"><i>
    <i class="ec-square-face-base"></i>
  </i>
```
This could be made like this:  =]:([] (or something)

This would make a Abraham Lincon looking emoticon, all with the font glyphs stacked to look like a singular icon. This allows you to make anything you want as part of your project, or use a system where your users could construct them through ASCII.

This lets you have your own emoticons that can just be built by you ahead of time and not dynamically user creatable, or you could let users make them. Either way. And, there would be a set of default, single icons that you can use without complex stacking.

This is all a concept right now, but that's the plan. If you want to join up, email erik@helloerik.com. You can illustrate, code, help make fonts, anything you want!
